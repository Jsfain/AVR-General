# AVR-General
Repository for general AVR modules


# Currently Included
1) SPI.C / SPI.H : Source/header for interacting with the SPI port of an AVR.
2) USART.C / USART.H : Source/header for interacting with USART port of an AVR microcontroller.   
3) PRINTS.C / PRINTS.H : Source/header for printing integers (decimal, hex, binary) and strings to screen via the USART.


# Implementation
See the source/header files for specifics


# Who may use
Anyone.


# Details
TARGET : ATmega1280.  These are intended to run against an ATmega1280 target, but any of these modules should be easily modifiable to run against other AVR targets.
LANGUAGE : C (avr-gcc/avr-libc)
